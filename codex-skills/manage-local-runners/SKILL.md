description: Manage the user's local GitHub Actions self-hosted runner platform from Codex. Use when the user asks to inspect, start, stop, restart, diagnose, validate, register, create, remove, or configure local runners for personal GitHub repositories, or asks whether a project's runner is healthy/available. Prefer the current repository when no target is specified. Support machine-local runner registries and on-demand systemd operation. Never expose registration tokens or perform destructive removal without explicit user intent.

# Manage Local GitHub Runners

Operate the user's shared local GitHub Actions runner installation safely and project-first.

This skill is for **personal/local runner administration**, not for editing GitHub Actions workflows unless the user explicitly asks for workflow changes.

## Platform location

Resolve the central installation in this order:

1. `$ACTIONS_RUNNERS_HOME`
2. `/home/alangomes/actions-runners`

```bash
RUNNERS_HOME="${ACTIONS_RUNNERS_HOME:-/home/alangomes/actions-runners}"
```

If `$RUNNERS_HOME/.env.local` exists, load it before resolving the registry:

```bash
if [[ -f "$RUNNERS_HOME/.env.local" ]]; then
  set -a
  source "$RUNNERS_HOME/.env.local"
  set +a
fi

RUNNERS_CONFIG="${RUNNERS_CONFIG:-$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.conf}"
RUNNER_BOOT_POLICY="${RUNNER_BOOT_POLICY:-on-demand}"
```

Do not assume runner definitions are versioned. Treat `RUNNERS_CONFIG` as machine-local state.

## Default operating model

The preferred policy is:

```text
systemd authority
+ boot disabled
+ runner started on demand
+ only runners needed by a project are started
```

Do not run `start all` unless the user explicitly requests the entire fleet.

When the user asks to work with "the runner" and a current Git repository exists, scope actions to runners mapped to that repository.

## Resolve the current repository

Use:

```bash
remote="$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || true)"
repo="$remote"
repo="${repo%.git}"
repo="${repo#git@github.com:}"
repo="${repo#ssh://git@github.com/}"
repo="${repo#https://github.com/}"
repo="${repo#http://github.com/}"
repo="${repo,,}"
```

A valid resolved repo must look like `owner/name`.

If no current repository can be resolved and the user did not name one, ask which repository to manage.

## Resolve runners mapped to a repository

Read `RUNNERS_CONFIG` rather than hard-coding runner names.

```bash
mapfile -t project_runners < <(
  awk -F'|' -v wanted="$repo" '
    /^[[:space:]]*#/ || NF < 5 { next }
    {
      name=$1
      mapped=$4
      enabled=$5

      gsub(/^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$/, "", name)
      gsub(/^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$/, "", mapped)
      gsub(/^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$/, "", enabled)

      if (tolower(mapped) == tolower(wanted) && tolower(enabled) != "false") {
        print name
      }
    }
  ' "$RUNNERS_CONFIG"
)
```

Never infer that a group covers a repository if the registry says otherwise.

## Common operations

For inventory:

```bash
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" list
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" groups
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runner-services.sh" plan all
```

For a named runner:

```bash
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" status "$runner"
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" health "$runner"
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" doctor "$runner"
```

Interpret on-demand systemd correctly:

- `active` + boot disabled: healthy and currently available;
- `inactive` + boot disabled: healthy idle runner;
- `failed`: unhealthy;
- registration-deleted evidence in logs: stale remote registration, not a systemd failure.

Do not call an on-demand idle runner broken merely because it is inactive.

### Start the current project's runners

```bash
for runner in "${project_runners[@]}"; do
  "$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" start "$runner"
done
```

Then validate status and health for each runner.

### Stop the current project's runners

```bash
for runner in "${project_runners[@]}"; do
  "$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" stop "$runner"
done
```

Stopping an on-demand runner is normal.

### Switch boot policy

When supported:

```bash
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runner-services.sh" on-demand "$runner"
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runner-services.sh" autostart "$runner"
```

Prefer `on-demand` for personal runners unless the user explicitly wants always-on.

## Register a runner for a personal repository

Use this when the user asks to create/cadastrar/adicionar a local runner for a personal GitHub project.

### Resolve and validate the repository

Accept either the current Git repository or explicit `owner/repo`.

```bash
gh repo view "$repo" --json nameWithOwner,viewerPermission
```

For automatic registration, require enough permission to manage Actions runners.

### Infer profile

Inspect files and workflows:

- `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `poetry.lock` -> `python`
- `pubspec.yaml` -> `flutter`
- `package.json` -> `node`
- `pom.xml`, `build.gradle*` -> `java`
- `go.mod` -> `go`
- `*.csproj`, `*.sln` -> `dotnet`
- otherwise -> `generic`

When multiple stacks exist, choose the profile required by Actions workflows.

### Build labels

Always include `local-runner`, plus useful stack/project labels. Do not add the final instance name manually; `configure-runner.sh` adds it.

### Obtain a short-lived registration token

Prefer authenticated GitHub CLI:

```bash
token="$(gh api --method POST "repos/$repo/actions/runners/registration-token" --jq .token)"
```

Never print, persist, or return the token.

If unauthorized, ask the user for the normal GitHub registration line instead of inventing credentials.

### Configure

```bash
github_line="./config.sh --url https://github.com/$repo --token $token"

"$RUNNERS_HOME/configure-runner.sh" \
  --github-line "$github_line" \
  --labels "$labels" \
  --profile "$profile" \
  --group "$group"

unset token github_line
```

Capture the final runner name from output.

Do not manually edit the registry when `configure-runner.sh` can update it.

### Install service and validate

```bash
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runner-services.sh" migrate "$runner_name"
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" doctor "$runner_name"
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" health "$runner_name"
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runner-services.sh" plan "$runner_name"
```

Under on-demand policy, desired state is service installed, boot disabled, idle until needed.

If the installed platform predates on-demand support, report that instead of using hidden systemd workarounds.

Optionally start to prove the GitHub session, then stop again if the user wants idle state.

## Diagnose failures

If a runner dies after start:

```bash
"$RUNNERS_HOME/runners.sh" logs "$runner" | tail -80
```

If logs contain:

```text
The runner registration has been deleted from the server
```

classify as stale GitHub registration. Do not repeatedly restart it.

Offer re-register or remove. Removal requires explicit user intent.

For duplicate sessions, confirm no other process/service is using the same runner directory or registration before killing anything.

For toolchain/cache issues:

```bash
"$RUNNERS_HOME/cache.sh" profiles
"$RUNNERS_HOME/cache.sh" doctor --profile "$profile"
```

## Remove a runner

Only on explicit remove/delete intent:

1. show resolved name, repo and path;
2. stop it;
3. uninstall via `runner-services.sh uninstall`;
4. remove its registry entry only after confirming the target;
5. remove local directory only if full local removal was requested;
6. do not delete another runner for the same repo.

## Reporting

Keep routine output compact:

```text
Local runner:
- repo: owner/project
- runner: project
- policy: on-demand
- state: active | idle | failed
- boot: disabled
- registration: healthy | stale
```

For new registration also report name, GitHub runner name, profile, labels without secrets, registry path, and systemd state.

## Prohibitions

- Never expose runner registration tokens.
- Never commit the machine-local runner registry.
- Never use `start all` unless explicitly requested.
- Never enable all runners at boot by default.
- Never reconfigure an existing runner without explicit intent.
- Never delete a runner because it is merely inactive under on-demand policy.
- Never edit unrelated workflows while managing local runners.
- Never claim GitHub registration health solely from a local process being alive.
